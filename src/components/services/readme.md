some notes on styles in the services section

Notice List margins and paddings

Notice in each Flex container:

- the p:first-child has margin-top to create spacing from the Formwork TYPE
- align-items: center; causes the image to not take full height

Notice BRIDGE DECK markup uses an additional <div className="spacing"></div> to create spacing between the h2,p and Anchor
